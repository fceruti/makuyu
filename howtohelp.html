          <p>
          Due to our lean size, commitment to our mission, and a close relationship with caretakers and administrators who run the children's home, a donation makes a real difference. Your donations go directly to supporting the children. Our trained staff are thoughtful in spending contributions that allows for high efficiency. We invite you to browse our website, visit our Children page, and donate if you find it within your heart and wallet to do so.</p>

          <h2>Option 1: Recurrinng Donations</h2>
          <p>continual support to help sustain us throughout the year. You may ask, "How can I really be making that much of a difference?" A monthly donation will go a long way!  It takes only $10 to pay for a week of meals for a child at the Makuyu Education Initiative. $100 will be enough to pay for all the chidren's meals for a week. The more you give, the more the children benefit. To sign up for a recurring donation, please select an option below!



Your donation will be charged to your credit card each month until you communicate differently.  If you'd like to make a recurring gift in another amount please contact us.</p>

          <h2>Option 2:One-time Donation </h2>
          <p>A one-time donation is, of course, welcome. We appreciate the help you can provide to MEI.</p>
          <h2>Option 3:Sponsor a child </h2>
          <p>Are you interested in sponsoring a child? Please check out which children are not being sponsored on our Children tab. We estimate that it will cost $64 per month to fully sponsor a child, including meals, clothing, supplies, and books. We will keep you updated frequently on their progress. </p>
