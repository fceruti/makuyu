          <h2>Boniface Nguge</h2>
          <p>Boniface was born 0n 22nd of October 2004. His mother is from a region close to Lake Victoria. When his parents separated, Boniface`s 4 siblings left to go and stay with his grandparents in the north.Only Boniface was left behind with his father. Boniface is taken care of by his aunt, because the father is a drunkard and cannot take care of the child. The aunt took in the boy, because he became homeless and had nothing to eat. It is difficult for aunt to take care of Boniface because she has 7 children; she doesn't have a fixed job. No sign of his mother. Boniface is very interested in studying even though he joined school late. </p>
