          <h2>Letter from Founder:</h2>
          <P>People often ask me, "Why do you do what you do?" and I always find it difficult to answer that question. I've heard a lot of different reasons why people decide to get involved with charities. Truth be told, I find a lot of the reasons unconvincing, at least for myself</P>
          <P>Some people say that we have a responsibility to help the poor because we find ourselves in more fortunate circumstances. Although that is true, I question whether we have a responsibility to do that. We have a responsibility to take care of our families. Donâ€™t get me wrong, it is nice to help the disadvantaged, because we did not cause their misfortune. Life caused it, and nobody said that life was supposed to be fair. Moreover, most of us worked hard to get where we are in life, so we should not feel guilty about our standard of living.</P>
          <P>But, despite all of those reasons, there was one question that keeps haunting me. One question that, try as I might, I could not find an answer to. If I was a 5 year old child and I had to go to sleep hungry, on the dirt floor and in the cold, I would want someone like myself to help me. That help would mean a world of difference to me. And so, I could not escape the fact that I was denying the help that I would have desperately wanted for myself had the roles been reversed. And so, I do it not because I feel responsible to help those kids and not because I feel guilty about not helping them, but because if I was one of them, I would want someone like me to help.</P>
          <P>Thanks for your support!</P>
