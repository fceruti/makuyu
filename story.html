          <h2>Mission: To provide underprivileged children with an opportunity to escape poverty.</h2>
          <p> The Makuyu Education Initiative (MEI) is an American based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. MEI began operations in July 2011 in Makuyu, Kenya. The mission of the Makuyu Education Centre is to provide underprivileged children with an opportunity to escape the vicious cycle of poverty by fighting malnutrition and other obstacles that can deter them from reaching their full potential. Many children in our program are orphans or have single mothers who are struggling to provide for their families. The Makuyu Education Initiative has recently transformed itself from a school into a children's home to better address the needs of the children. The children will be taken care of at the children's home and sponsored to go to a local school. In addition, the children will have access to healthcare, nutritious meals, tutoring, and other essentials aimed at improving their lives.</p>
